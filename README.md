# Dynamic_Neural_Predictive_Fair_Scheduling_OS_Algorithm
ðŸŽ¯ Combine fairness, predictive adaptation, and learning-based burst estimation to create a smart, adaptive scheduler that: 1. Learns and predicts process behavior over time.  2. Balances short jobs, I/O bound tasks, and long CPU jobs. 3. Ensures fair CPU access with a dynamic quantum and priority.

ðŸ§  Key Concepts in DNPFS:

1. **Neural Prediction** (lightweight ML model per process):
    - Use a shallow model (e.g., exponentially weighted average or small neural net) to **predict next CPU burst**.
    - Update burst predictions based on actual behavior (similar to SJF but learned).
2. **Dynamic Quantum Allocation**:
    - Instead of a fixed quantum (like Round Robin), dynamically adjust quantum based on:
        - Past behavior (e.g., if a process tends to use little CPU)
        - Priority level and fairness window
3. **Fairness Credit System**:
    - Each process gets **credits** that increase when they wait.
    - Scheduler selects process based on a **combined score**:
        
        ```
        ini
        CopyEdit
        Score = Î± * (1 / predicted_burst) + Î² * fairness_credit + Î³ * priority
        
        ```
        
        - You define Î±, Î², and Î³ based on system goals (e.g., low latency vs. fairness).
4. **Aging + Feedback**:
    - If a process waits too long or gets starved, boost its score dynamically (aging).
    - Penalize those abusing the CPU (high burst deviation).
